# webcam-stream

Here you will find a [tutorial](Tutorial.md) on how to setup your Raspberry Pi to stream video from a webcam in a nice and secure enough manner.

While trying to DIY such a thing, I didn't find a nice and complete set of steps, this tutorial is an attempt to fix it.
 
If you find any kind of errors or mistakes - please [fill in an issue](https://github.com/DeTeam/webcam-stream/issues/new) or, if you have time, contribute a PR right away.


It's important that:

* Information stays up to date
* Security is covered so that private info is not exposed
* Steps are straightforward enough and don't require very deep knowledge of underlying tools
